            <summary>What is HTML?</summary>
            <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of web pages. It's the standard language used to
                create and structure content on the internet. Think of it as the blueprint that tells a web browser how
                to display text, images, links, and other elements.</p>
            <p>It works using "tags" like for paragraphs, for headings, and for links. While HTML organizes the content,
                it's often paired with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What is CSS?</summary>
            <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document
                written in HTML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of web pages.</p>
            <p>CSS allows developers to separate content from design, making it easier to maintain and update websites.
                It uses selectors to apply styles to specific elements, enabling responsive design and consistent
                styling across multiple pages.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What is JavaScript?</summary>
            <p>JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive web pages. It allows developers to create
                dynamic content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more.</p>
            <p>JavaScript runs in the browser, making it essential for client-side scripting. It's often used alongside
                HTML and CSS to enhance user experience by responding to user actions like clicks, form submissions, and
                page loads.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What is a web browser?</summary>
            <p>A web browser is a software application used to access and view websites on the internet. It interprets
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display web pages as intended by their developers.</p>
            <p>Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. They provide
                features like bookmarks, tabs, and extensions to enhance user experience while browsing the web.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What is a web server?</summary>
            <p>A web server is a computer system that stores, processes, and delivers web pages to users over the
                internet. It responds to requests from web browsers by serving the requested content, such as HTML
                files, images, and videos.</p>
            <p>Web servers use protocols like HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) to communicate with browsers. They can
                host multiple websites and handle various types of content, making them essential for delivering online
                services.</p>
